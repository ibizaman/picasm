* Toolbar menu

* Lookup-table generator

* Maybe some yasnippet templates for common control structures?

* I don't think labels on the same line as instructions are indented properly

and there are hundreds of chips. Not my idea of a good time...

* Configuration word editor

* Changing the selected chip should edit/insert the "list p=<chip>" and "#include <chip.inc>" directives

* Changing the selected chip should force a recalculate of the configuration word
